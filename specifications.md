# Cartesi API Specification

Version: 0.0.1-wip

## Introduction

The Cartesi API Specification defines a standard, language-agnostic interface
to Cartesi DApps, to better document how to interact with the distributed
applications. The definition can be automatically generated from an existing
DApp and also used to generate both the DApp and client codes.

## Specifications

### Format

The Cartesi API Specification file is a JSON object, which may be represented
either in JSON or YAML format.

## Schema

### CartesiAPI Object

This is the root object of a Cartesi API Description document.

Fields:

| Field Name | Type   | Description |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| cartesiapi | string | **REQUIRED**. This must be the version of the CartesiAPI Specification for the current document, as a string. This is not related to the Dapp version, which should be in the `info.verion` key. |
| info       | [Info Object](#info-object) | **REQUIRED**. Provides metadata about the DApp. |
| operations | \[[Operation Object](#operation-object)\] | **REQUIRED**. Available ways to interact with the DApp. |
| components | [Components Object](#components-object) | Element to hold various schemas for the document |
| tags       | \[[Tag Object](#tag-object)\] | A list of tags used by the document with additional metadata. |
| externalDocs | [External Documentation Object](#external-documentation-object) | Additional external documentation |

### Info Object

Metadata about the DApp. These metadata may be used by the clients and may be
used to generate a presentation of the documentation.

Fields:

| Field Name | Type   | Description |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| title      | string | **REQUIRED**. The title of the DApp. |
| version    | string | **REQUIRED**. The version of the DApp. |
| summary    | string | A short summary of the DApp. |
| description | string | A long form description for the document. Can use Markdown for rich text representation. |
| termsOfService | string | A URL to the Terms of Service for the DApp. |
| license    | [License Object](#license-object) | The license information for the DApp |
| contact    | [Contact Object](#contact-object) | The contact information for the DApp |

### License Object

Licensing information for the DApp

Fields:

| Field Name | Type   | Description |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| name       | string | **REQUIRED**. The license name for the DApp. |
| identifier | string | An [SPDX](https://spdx.org/spdx-specification-21-web-version#h.jxpfx0ykyb60) license expression for the DApp. The `identifier` field is mutually exclusive of the `url` field. |
| url | string | A URL to the license used for the DApp. The `url` field is mutually exclusive of the `identifier` field. |

### Contact Object

Contact information for the DApp

Fields:

| Field Name | Type   | Description |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| name       | string | Name of the contact person/organization. |
| url        | string | The URL pointing to the contact information. |
| email      | string | The email address of the contact person/organization |

### Operation Object

Describe an operation offered by the DApp.

Fields:

| Field Name  | Type   | Description |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| operationId | string | A unique string used to identify this operation. The id MUST be unique among all operations for this DApp. The `operationId` value is case-sensitive, and MAY be used by automated tools for code generation, therefore, it is recommended to follow common programming naming conventions. |
| summary     | string | A short summary for the operation. |
| description | string | A long form description for the operation. Can use Markdown for rich text representation. |
| externalDocs | [External Documentation Object](#external-documentation-object) | Additional external documentation for the opretaion. |
| tags | \[string\] | A list of tags for documentation control. Tags can be used for logical grouping of operations by resources or any other qualifier. |
| :memo: request_type | string | **REQUIRED**. The type of the operation for the Cartesi Machine. It MUST be either `"advance"` for requests that arrive via a Layer 1 call to addInput, or `"inspect"` for requests that arrive via inspect queries. |
| :memo: input | [Input Object](#input-object) \| [Reference Object](#reference-object) | A description of the expected input for this operation. |
| :memo: responses | [Responses Object](#responses-object) | A description of the possible responses generated by this operation. |
| :memo: sender | [Address Object](#address-object) \| [Reference Object](#reference-object) | Specifies who is allowed to call this operation. If not specified, no restrictions should be applied to the caller. |

Discussion points:

- Advances and Inspects are represented as the `request_type` field, instead of
  of having dedicated objects, as the format for the underlying operations, for
  the most part, can be identical.
- A msg_sender restriction is more akin to permissions than to input formatting.
  I think it should be specified in the Operation Level.

### Input Object

Describes how the input should be formed for the current operation.

Fixed Fields:

| Field Name  | Type   | Description |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| description | string | A long form description for the input. Can use Markdown for rich text representation. |
| contentType | string | The type of the contents of this input. See discussions below for how to specify this format. |
| header      | string | Specify whether the content should be prefixed with a sequence of bytes, and how these bytes are formed. See discussion below. |
| selectors   | \[string\] | If no header is supplied, the `selectors` field specifies which fields of the schema are used by the application to match this operation. |
| schema      | [Schema Object](#schema-object) | The schema description for the input |

Discussion points:

- ContentType should be one of the following:
  - `ethereum/abi-packed`
  - `ethereum/abi`
  - Any MIME type
- The `ethereum/abi` and `ethereum/abi-packed` types are not registered IANA
  media types. According to [RFC 6838](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6838), more appropriate names would be `application/x.ethereum.abi` or `application/x.ethereum.abi-packed` as tey use the unregistered facet tree.
- If using ABI or ABI-packed encoding, the types reported in the schema should be valid Solidity types.
- A null `header` means that nothing should be prefixed to the input.
- Header can be one of the following:
  - `operationId` to prefix the raw `operationId`
  - `functionKeccak`: first 4 bytes of the keccak256 of the `operationId`
  - `functionSelector`: first 4 bytes of the keccak256 checksum of the function signature, which is composed by the `operationId` and the data types for the parameters of the function.
