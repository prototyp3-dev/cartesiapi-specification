# The CartesiAPI Specification

The CartesiAPI Specification is an experimental standard for describing, in a
language-agnostic way, how to interact with a Cartesi DApp, and how to discover
its capabilities.

The ideas and format described in this repository are heavily influenced by the
[OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification), but
adapted to the different context of interacting with a Cartesi-based Distributed
Application, both via Layer 1 inputs or via inspects.
